   *   what a slow answer from a superseded account must not do. Checking only
   *   the *identity* was not enough: two refreshes for the same account can
   *   still finish out of order, and the older one would win.
   * - **`resolve()`, not `current()`.** Only `resolve()` performs the locked,
   *   single-flight token renewal. Reading `current()` meant an expired token
   *   made every catalog request fail until something else happened to refresh
